## Opinion Exchanger (OExchanger)

Opinion Exchanger (OExchanger) is an application where everyone can  exchange their opinion on a specific topic. You can think OExchanger as the simpler Reddit.

## Project Architecture

OExchanger is built with Laravel and is a GraphQL API that allows you to create a new group, join existing ones & interact with other members. I used Laravel Sail for the development so the whole installation locally can be made very easy.

I went with the API approach in order to implement the interface through React (& React Native for mobiles).
